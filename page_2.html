        <div>Hi! I'm a current MADS student, with an undergraduate background in Bioinformatics. I first learned Python six years ago and have been enamored by its capabilities ever since. I'm here to help with everything from basic Python to more advanced concepts. I believe in using small, concrete examples to gain intuition before diving into more mathematical terms. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading a good book (usually fiction), practicing Jiu-Jitsu, or enjoying the outdoors on a hike.</div>
